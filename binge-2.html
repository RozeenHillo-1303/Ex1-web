        best Quotes from the series 
      </h2>
    <ol>
         <li><b><i>Aslan Bey, who was born as an orphan and raised by his grandmother Aziza,<br>
           saw in him the spirit of revenge for his parents, who were killed by Hazar Shadoglu<br>
            as claimed by his grandmother Aziza. </i></b></li>
         <li><i>Ryan Shadoglu married after he entered his heart somewhat, but his grandmother<br>
          reminded him of his revenge, and he left her the next day to seek revenge,<br>
           but his heart did not obey him by doing so, so he returned to it and from here <br>
           begins the story of the impossible love between the hammer and the anvil.<br>
            Those who believe that the story ends here do not realize that love is a<br>
             seed in the soil of revenge.</i></li>
